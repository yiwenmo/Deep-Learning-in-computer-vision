# Deep-Learning-in-computer-vision
I have studied the ML course when i was graduate student in first semester during that time i learned about Scikit-Learn and later i learned the Deep Learning in CV course which is taught by my fav teacher, the code files are the homework that i accomplished by myself and use the Pytorch module.

In my files, each assignment has a core theme, more detailed content shown below:
- HW1: The basic concept of Support Vector Machine
- HW2: In HW2-1.pdf is the handwritten of Forward and Backpropagation process within the corresponding neural network. HW2-1.ipynb is the correct answer of the calculation. In HW2-2 is to create a regression model that is defined by yourself and have the completed train process.
- HW3: The concept of convolution operation, kernel, and the calculation through martrix. Also comparison of different filters. 
- HW4: Build the classification model with AnimalDataset which can get from Kaggle.
- HW5: Feature detector for different methods and feature matching
- HW6: Homography and stitching through OpenCV module
