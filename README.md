# Deep-Learning-in-computer-vision
I have studied the ML course when i was graduate student in first semester and later i learned the Deep Learning in CV course which is taught by my fav teacher, the code files are the homework that i accomplished by myself.

In my files, each assignment has a core theme, more detailed content shown below:
- HW1: The basic concept of Support Vector Machine
- HW2: In HW2-1.pdf is the handwritten of Forward and Backpropagation process within the corresponding neural network. HW2-1.ipynb is the correct answer of the calculation. In HW2-2 is to create a regression model that is defined by yourself and have the completed train process.
